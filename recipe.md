Chop finely onion, capsicum and tomato. I used cheery tomato so sliced it.
Spread 1/4 tsp of pizza/ pasta sauce in the middle. Arrange tomato over it.
Top it with few chopped capsicum and onion. Keep grated cheese over it.  (thaw well so that it doesnâ€™t fall apart.
Preheat oven at 220 deg C for 10 mins. Bake for 5-7 mins or until the cheese turns golden here and there.
Once done, take out and sprinkle some chilli flakes, Italian seasoning.
